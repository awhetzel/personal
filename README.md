# Simple Vue personal website

## If I get time I plan to: 

- Hook up a backend via REST api (probably node.js/express but maybe Python/Flask)

- Do some more work to improve the UI, maybe add to my work history section and make it a carousel or something

- Move all the static text  and other data to the backend

- Maybe setup an admin login after I get a backend hooked up so I can update things without changing code 

I threw this together in a few hours and then got sidetracked by a side gig =)
